# US_States_QuizGame

This is a simple Python program that allows users to play a game where they guess the names of US states. The program displays a map of the United States and prompts the
user to enter the name of a state. If the user guesses correctly, the program marks the state on the map and keeps track of the score. The game continues until the user 
guesses all 50 states or decides to exit.
